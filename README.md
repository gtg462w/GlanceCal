# GlanceCal
A very simple iOS Today View widget for calendar events

----

### The Problem

The default iOS Calendar Today View widgets don't make much sense to me. At a glance I only really need to know about events that are today or tomorrow.

### The Solution

Make a really quick and simple Today View widget app that presents all the events scheduled for later today and tomorrow.

### Issues

I don't know anything about Swift, iOS development or Xcode. I like learning by trial and error so this project will probably contain a lot of blinding errors that I don't know about yet (but hopefully none that I do know about...).

### TODO:
- Display events in separate "Today" and "Tomorrow" widgets.
    - Widget size/resize is not correct
    - Calendar colour on the left
    - Fetch data within host app or within widget?
    - Duplicate today widget to a tomorrow widget
- Consider adding reminders due today and tomorrow (and overdue?).
- Alarms set in clock app would also be good but doesn't seem possible.
